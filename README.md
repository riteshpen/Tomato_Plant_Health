# Tomato_Health


## Information

Farmers face economic loss and crop waste every year due to various diseases in tomato plants. The diseases I will be accounting for
are early blight and late blight. Early blight is caused by a fungus and late blight is caused by a microorganism. If the plant has 
any of these diseases it will not produce tomatoes which negatively affects the farmer. 
In this project, I will be creating a model to predict whether the tomato is healthy or has an early blight 
or late-blight disease using image classification using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). 
Farmers can use this technology to predict whether their tomato plant has any diseases.
